# VBA and Wall Street

## Background

Used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Steps

1. Create a new repository for this project called `VBA-challenge`. 

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the VBA Challenges. Use the folder name to correspond to the challenge: **VBAStocks**.

4. Inside the folder that you just created, add any VBA files. Theses will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Stock market analyst

## Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


### Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
